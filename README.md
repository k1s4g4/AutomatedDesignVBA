  This is a project i made in University for a course called "Programming Techniques in Structural Engineering". This course is my first attempt in programming with real programming languages after high school when i was taught programming but in a fake language so i never had a real program i made my own on pc. I was impressed with this course and i decided to make a project that was not required to pass. 
  
  It is a program that uses an input file for some areas, which are saved in groups, asks you for the height of the groups and finally creates a 3D Model of the region/city in Autocad. If you don't have an input file the program is designed to ask you questions about the region/city and you can save the file for using whenever you want. If you speak Greek there is a pdf that describes the program. In InputFiles Folder there are some input files.
